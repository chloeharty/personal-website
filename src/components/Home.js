            <p>
                My name is Chloe Harty. I am a second-year Software Engineering student at the University of Victoria (UVic).
                I grew up in Sherwood, Oregon where I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Sherwood High School and I graduated with 
                an Advanced Honors Diploma in 2023. My extended family resides in Southern Alberta and I’ve spent many summers 
                in remote corners of the prairies. UVic was the perfect middle ground between my two homes. I chose to pursue 
                engineering because I have a long-standing passion for design, creativity, and the pursuit of innovation. The 
                exceptional caliber of education and the software engineering specific program solidified my decision to attend 
                UVic. Explore my website to discover my academic clubs, projects, and the early creative designs that motivated 
                me to become an engineer.
